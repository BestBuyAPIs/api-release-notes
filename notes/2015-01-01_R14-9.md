## R14.9 - 2015-01-01
### Changed
- Enhanced `Open Box` endpoint in **[Buying Options API](https://bestbuyapis.github.io/api-documentation/#buying-options-open-box-api)** to allow searching by Category or Subcategory
- Renamed the `Open Box Multi SKU` endpoint to `Open Box All SKUs`
- Removed `arg` from Buying Options and Recommendations endpoints, as the information was already available in the canonical URL
