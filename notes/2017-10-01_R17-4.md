## R17.4 - 2017-10-01

### Added
- We have a new attribute set that will provide a broader range of product relationships â€“ currently the data includes color and size relationships as well as some brand collections, though these relationship types will expand over time. The new attribute is `productVariations` and includes `variations.name` and `variations.value` by `productVariations.sku.` 
- The `discs[].tracks)` attribute set shows name and sequence for songs on the designated music SKU
- Contract pricing for mobile devices (`contracts[].type,` `contracts[].prices,` `contracts[].priceNote,` etc): this attribute set reflects monthly pricing for activated devices such as mobile phones and tablets, including number of payments, current, and regular pricing


### Changed

- These three attributes attributes are deprecated: `relatedProducts,` `productFamilies,` and `frequentlyPurchasedWith.` Data in these fields may already be stale. **We will be deleting these attributes from the response document in early 2018: this is a change in our contract.**
- `onlineAvailabilityText,` `onlineAvailabilityTextHtml,` `inStoreAvailabilityText,` and `inStoreAvailabilityTextHtml` are deprecated fields. The data in these fields may not match availability on BestBuy.com and values are likely to become stale in the coming weeks.
- Content changes will start flowing through our APIs that will replace our 10-digit SKUs (primarily used with digital products) to 7-digit SKUs. If you have logic in place based on SKU length, be aware of this change.
