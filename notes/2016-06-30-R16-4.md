## R16.4 - 2016-06-30
### Added
- Expanding on the existing `offers.type` of `digital_insert`, `gift_with_purchase` is now also being exposed. This will help API consumers identify special deals where purchase of an item entitles the end-user to another item at a discount

### Changed
- Before this release, if an API query string included an unknown parameter the system would return an HTTP 400 error. Although some very intelligent API specs prefer the previous pattern (such as **https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cc-api-v3-style-guide#query-parameters**), we've made a changem to ignore unknown parameters in hopes that applying the Robustness principle (**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle**) to the API simplifies adoption of new parameters.
- The API is working on reducing the number of similar URL fields in our results, with the goal of reducing from 8 fields to 2. This release is the first step in that effort, moving URLs from pointing to www.bestbuy.com/... to api.bestbuy.com/click... This change will enable future features not previously possible, such as expanded Add To Cart functionality and automatic attachment of affiliate codes. A newsletter and blog post will be released soon to elaborate on this change.

### Bug Fix
- From 6/16 through 6/23, several products in the API were returning `addToCart` as blank. This has been fixed.
