## R15.5 2015-05-01
### Changed
- Updated the Product Offers Deal of the Day source
- No longer populating Deal of the Day `offers.text` field, as it was determined to be repetitive
- No longer publishing a SKU with a rank of 1 for the following attributes due to past confusion:
 - `bestSellingRank`
 - `salesRankShortTerm`
 - `salesRankMediumTerm`
 - `salesRankLongTerm`
- Removed Featured Offers from Products API, as this data has evolved into landing pages on BESTBUY.COM instead of individual SKUs
