## R16.3 - 2016-05-30
### Changed
- Shipping cost will now be calculated based on shippingLevelsOfService `serviceLevelId` rather than `serviceLevelName`. Users will not see a difference in the response document.
- Certain products available for presale have displayed a dummy `releaseDate` of 12/31/YYYY. To avoid customer confusion, this date will now pass as null.
