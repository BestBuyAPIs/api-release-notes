## R16.1 - 2016-01-01
### Changed 
Due to alterations in our source systems, the following changes have been made in our **[Products API](https://bestbuyapis.github.io/api-documentation/#products-api)**:   
- Bundle SKUs (SKUs that include multiple products in the purchase, e.g., a DSLR camera, lens and case sold together where type=bundle) will not include shipping data in the response.     
- `accessories` attribute is now deprecated and will no longer contain suggested accessory SKUs. 
- `bestBuyItemID` is a deprecated attribute and will return a null value. This is a field that was hidden by default and should not impact many customers. Please use the sku identifier as a unique identifier for all Best Buy products.
