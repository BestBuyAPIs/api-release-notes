## R17.1 - 2016-05-30
### Changed
- Shipping cost will now be calculated based on LevelOfShipping ID rather than LevelOfShipping name. Users will not see a difference in the response document.
- Certain products available for presale have displayed a dummy release date of 12/31/YYYY. To avoid customer confusion, this date will now pass as null.
