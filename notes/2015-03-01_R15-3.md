## R15.3 2015-03-01
### Added 
- `Active Adventurer` endpoint to the **[SmartList API](https://developer.bestbuy.com/documentation/smartLists-api)**, providing top-rated fitness and outdoor products
- Categories API to the **[Query Builder](http://bestbuyapis.github.io/bby-query-builder/#/productSearch)** tool, allowing queries based on:
 - All Categories
 - Top Level Categories
 - Search Categories by Name
 - Search Categories by Category Id
 
### Changed 
- Removed mock 404, as we have improved our code enough to make it rare and extraneous
- Now including `pageSize` and `page` as part of the Canonical URL in our response document. This will impact the following endpoints:
 - Open Box by Category
 - Open Box All SKUs
